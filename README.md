# Univault API Documentation

## Admin Side

This section describes the API endpoint used for retrieving and rendering branch data related to a specific university.

### 1. Get Branches (GET)

**Endpoint:** `/createBranchGet/:id`  
**Method:** GET

**Description:** Retrieves all branches associated with a specific university and renders them on a view page.

**Path Parameters:**
- `id` (string, required): The ID of the university for which branch data is to be retrieved.

**Response:**
- **Status 200**: Renders the `branch.ejs` view template with branch data for the specified university.

**Error Handling:**
- **Status 500**: If there is an error during data retrieval, it logs the error but does not send a response message. The rendering of the view may be affected.

**Request Example:**

```exports.createBranchGet = {
  controller: async (req, res) => {
    try {
      // query to find branch where university id matches
      const branchData = await db.branches.findAll({where : {
        uniId : req.params.id
      },order : ['name']});
      res.render("../views/admin/branch.ejs", { branchData});
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  },
};

```
